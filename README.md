# meta-visualization
A spectral method for assessing and combining multiple data visualizations.

For a collection of visualizations of a dataset, the method provides a quantitative measure -- eigenscore -- of relative performance of each visualization in a pointwise manner, which induces a ranking of these visualizations in terms of their concordance to the underlying true structures of the data. On the other hand, the method automatically combines strengths and ameliorates weakness of multiple visualizations, leading to a meta-visualization which is  provably better than all the candidate visualizations.
